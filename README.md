### Hi, I am Lekan 🧑🏿‍💻👋🏿

- I am a Full-Stack Software Engineer that enjoys building cool MERN stuff ✨✨
- As you can tell from my github repos I write more languages than I can speak but please do not ask me to write python 🤝🏿
- I enjoy writing JavaScript and I am currently getting more familiar with [reactJS](https://reactjs.org/) 🏹
- Visit my [personal website](https://areezy.github.io/) if you've got a minute but it is getting rebuilt soon with some fancy new static site tech I have my eye on. 👀💎
